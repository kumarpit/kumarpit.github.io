Hi again! This page includes some more information about me, such as some insight into my motivations, a brief overview of my experiences, and my career goals.

### Interests
My interest in computer science and mathematics began simply -- I enjoyed writing computer programs in high school, and thrived in the struggles of working through hard (for me, at least) problems in mathematics. Over my years at university, I found myself drawn to the more theoretical side of computer science - in particular, I am deeply interested in the design of programming languages, and somewhat tangentially, in studying the characteristics of _powerful_ abstractions. 

Examples of abstractions or programming paradigms that I find especially powerful include ["language-oriented programming"](https://beautifulracket.com/appendix/why-lop-why-racket.html), wherein rather than being restricted by the features of the host language, developers invent their own constructs that more naturally model their domain and allow for a more declarative and concise style of programming. Additionally, I am also studying [_logic programming_](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book-Z-H-29.html#%_sec_4.4), a programming paradigm wherein computation is expressed in terms of relations rather than single-valued functions, allowing developers to run computations "backwards" (i.e derive inputs from outputs) -- all from a single definition!

Ultimately, I value _elegance_ in programs. I enjoy the study of the various programming paradigms and programming language features, each with its own strengths and tradeoffs, that shape how we think about computation. A high-level goal of mine in my career is to make it easier for developers to combine ideas from diverse paradigms to build more expressive and beautiful abstractions. 

### Experience
I have completed 24 months of co-op. This was divided into two 8 month terms and two 4 month terms. In reverse chronological order:

<details>
<summary><strong>Software Engineer Intern at Shopify (Fall 2025)</strong></summary>

I was on the Payments Infrastructure team and worked on optimizing database utilization to make checkouts faster and more resilient to high loads. As personal side quests, I also contributed to Shopify's Ruby Rails LSP add-on and built an internal Ruby LSP add-on that provided IDE support for fixtures (test data). I also gave a talk on the importance of building tools to make development easier, and shared my experience building Rooble, a [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org)-like tool enabling fuzzy type-signature search for RBI files.

One of the highlights of my internship was being invited to lunch with [Tobias Lütke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Lütke) (CEO, Shopify) as part of a small group of "high-impact" interns. Another highlight included being in the office during BFCM week, and watching the insane numbers and graphs on our monitoring dashboards!

<summary><strong>Software Engineer Intern at SAP (Winter, Summer 2025)</strong></summary>

I was part of the Orchestrated Tenant Deletion team, where I worked on migrating tenant data deletion workflows from [AWS SWF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/welcome.html) to [Temporal](https://temporal.io), and building dashboards/analytics to track workflow progress, error rates, and other SLAs.

<summary><strong>Site Reliability Engineer Intern at Visier (Winter, Summer 2024)</strong></summary>

I worked on maintaining Visier's cloud infrastructure and contributed to the first phase rollout of Visier's platform on Azure. I wrote a bunch of Terraform, Packer, and other IaC modules, and got familiar with AWS and Azure's cloud offerings and primitives.

<details>
<summary><strong>Software Engineer Intern at Vidyard (Winter 2023)</strong></summary>

This was my first internship! I was on the billing team and worked on migrating Vidyard's billing platform from [Zuora](https://docs.zuora.com/en/zuora-payments) to [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com). This was the first time I used Ruby and one of the highlights of my internship was discovering Ruby's meta-programming capabilities. Another highlight was being involved in the rollout of my team's work and seeing Vidyard's first ever self-serve sale show up on the Stripe dashboard.

### Research
As part of the [SIGPLAN-M mentorship program](https://www.sigplan.org/LongTermMentoring/), I am working with [Dr. William E. Byrd](https://webyrd.net/) on exploring relational programming and the [miniKanren ecosystem](https://minikanren.org/). In particular, I am currently exploring extensions to the work on [metaKanren](https://icfp21.sigplan.org/details/minikanren-2021-papers/4/metaKanren-Towards-a-Metacircular-Relational-Interpreter), with the goal of achieving a relational meta-circular interpreter for miniKanren. This is my first foray into the world of academia, and I am extremely grateful for the existence of a program like SIGPLAN-M.

### Outside Work/School
- I enjoy sketching and making art. I doodle a lot. I'm currently interested in the ["Urban Sketching"](https://urbansketchers.org/) style. I'll eventually upload my sketchbooks on this site. 
- I also enjoy weightlifting. My favourite exercise is the barbell squat (ATG, always). My short term goal is to get to a 3-plate squat (140kg/315lbs) - my current best is 120kg/265lbs. I don't like benching.
- I like reading. I'm trying to get more consistent with actually finishing the books I start.
