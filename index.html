<p>Hey! I'm Arpit. Welcome to my little corner of the internet. Here you can find a collection of my thoughts and notes on topics that interest me - mainly relating to programming language theory, developer tooling, and distributed systems. A lot on this site is under construction.</p>

<p>I'm currently in the final year of my undergraduate studies at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a> where I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm currently a software engineer intern at <a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a>, where I am on the Payments Infrastructure team and working on optimizing database utilization to make checkouts faster and more resilient to high loads. Additionally, I'm enrolled in the <a href="https://www.sigplan.org/LongTermMentoring/">SIGPLAN-M mentorship program</a>, where I'm working with <a href="http://webyrd.net/">Dr. William E. Byrd</a> on exploring relational programming and the <a href="https://minikanren.org/">miniKanren ecosystem</a>.</p>

<p>I'm looking for full-time opportunities in industry starting from May 2026 - if you are hiring engineers to work on anything relating to programming languages or large-scale systems, please do let me know! You can find my contact information below.</p>
