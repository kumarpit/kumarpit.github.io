<p>Hey! I'm Arpit. Welcome to my little corner of the internet. Here you can find a collection of my thoughts and notes on topics that interest me - mainly relating to programming language theory, developer tooling, and distributed systems. A lot on this site is under construction.</p>

<p>I'm currently in the final year of my undergraduate studies at the University of British Columbia where I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm currently a software engineer intern at Shopify, where I am on the Payments Infrastructure team and working on optimizing database utilization to make checkouts faster and more resilient to high loads. Additionally, I'm enrolled in the SIGPLAN-M mentorship program, where I'm working with Dr. William E. Byrd on exploring relational programming and the miniKanren ecosystem.</p>

<p>I'm looking for full-time opportunities in industry starting from May 2026 - if you are hiring engineers to work on anything relating to programming languages or large-sclae systems, please do let me know! You can find my contact information below.</p>
