            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi again! This page includes some more information about me, as well as some insight into my motivations and my goals for my career.</p>
<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>
<p>My reasons for choosing computer science and mathematics as my fields of study are rather uninteresting - I “enjoyed” these subjects. I enjoyed building computer programs in high school, and thrived in the struggles of working through hard (for me, atleast) problems in mathematics. Over my years at university, I found myself drawn to the more theoretical side of computer science - in particular, I am deeply interested in the design of programming languages, and somewhat tangentially, in studying the characteristics of powerful abstractions. I love the idea of “language-oriented programming”, wherein rather than being restricted by the features of the host language, developers invent their own constructs that more naturally model their domain and allow for a declarative style of programming.</p>
<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>
<p>I have completed 24 months of co-op. This was divided into two 8 month terms and two 4 month terms. In reverse chronological order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software Engineer Intern at Shopify (Fall 2025)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was on the Payments Infrastructure team and worked on optimizing database utilization to make checkouts faster and more resilient to high loads. As personal side quests, I also contributed to the Ruby LSP and built my own Ruby LSP add-on that provided IDE support for fixtures. I also gave a talk on the importance of building tools to make development easier, and shared a few tools I had built in my time as an intern (such as Rooble, a Hoogle-like tool for fuzzy type-signature search for RBI files).</p>
<ul>
<li>Software Engineer Intern at SAP (Winter, Summer 2025)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was part of the Orchestrated Tenant Deletion team, where I worked on migrating tenant data deletion workflows from AWS SWF to Temporal, and building dashboards/analytics to track workflow progress, error rates, and other SLAs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Site Reliability Engineer Intern at Visier (Winter, Summer 2024)</li>
</ul>
<p>I worked on maintaining Visier’s cloud infrastructure (AWS) and contributed to the first phase rollout of Visier’s platform on Azure. I wrote a bunch of terraform, packer, and other IaC modules, got familiar with AWS and Azure’s cloud offerings and consoles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Software Engineer Intern at Vidyard (Winter 2023)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first internship - I was on the billing team and worked on migrating Vidyard’s billing platform from Zuora to Stripe. This was the first time I used Ruby and one of the highlights of my internship was discovering meta-programming. Another highlight was watching the rollout and seeing Vidyard’s first ever self-serve sale show up on our Stripe dashboard.</p>
<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p>As part of the SIGPLAN-M mentorship program, I am working with Dr. William E. Byrd on exploring relational programming and the miniKanren ecosystem. In particular, I am currently exploring extensions to the work on metaKanren, with the goal of achieving a relational meta-circular interpreter for miniKanren. This is my first foray into the world of academia, and I am extremely grateful for the existence of a program like SIGPLAN-M.</p>
<h3 id="outside-workschool">Outside Work/School</h3>
<ul>
<li>I enjoy sketching and making art. I doodle a lot. Maybe one day I’ll have my own zine collection like <a href="https://wizardzines.com">Julia Evans</a>.</li>
<li>I also enjoy weightlifting. My favourite exercise is the barbell squat (ATG, always). My short term goal is to get to a 3-plate squat (140kg/315lbs) - my current best is 120kg/265lbs. I don’t like benching.</li>
</ul>
