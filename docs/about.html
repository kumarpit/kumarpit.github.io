            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m Arpit. I am in my fourth year at UBC, majoring in
Mathematics and Computer Science. I find these disciplines
fascinating and greatly rewarding - there are only a few things in
life that feel as good as flowing through a proof or coming up with
neat abstractions. I enjoy building software and am always learning
about new technologies and design principles. Outside of school, I
am interested in art and weightlifting. Recently, I have gotten into
running and am learning to play the Ukulele.</p>
<p>I have interned at Visier as a Site Reliability Engineer - the most
influential experience in my career so far. I participated in
infrastructure design discussions, optimized build pipelines, worked
on several security improvements, wrote lambdas and a ton of IaC
modules, witnessed production fires and postmortems, and spent hours
on end reading about AWS and Azure services. The world of SRE was
very new to me but it has fundamentally changed how I think about
building software and is definitely a role I see myself in down the
line.</p>
<p>I have also interned at Vidyard as a Software Engineering Intern on
the Upgrade (Billing) team. There, I worked with Ruby on Rails and
contributed to the migration to Stripe in order to enable self-serve
purchases. This was my first professional experience and my first
time using Ruby. One of my highlights of this internship was
discovering Ruby’s metaprogramming capabilities. My goals in life
are rather simple. I just want to continuously push the limits of my
capabilities and learn as much as I can from the extremely talented
people I have the fortune of conversing with. I hope to be a
productive and impactful software engineer capable of leading
large-scale projects - but more importantly, I hope I can bring some
positivity and smiles in the lives of those around me.</p>
